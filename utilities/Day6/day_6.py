 Challenge: Daily Learning Journal Logger

Build a Python script that allows you to maintain a daily learning journal. Each entry will be saved into a `.txt` file along with a timestamp.

Your program should:
1. Ask the user what they learned today.
2. Add the entry to a file called `learning_journal.txt`.
3. Each entry should include the date and time it was written.
4. The journal should **append** new entries rather than overwrite.

Bonus:
- Add an optional rating (1-5) for how productive the day was.
- Show a confirmation message after saving the entry.
- Make sure the format is clean and easy to read when opening the file.

Example:
📅 2025-06-14 — 10:45 AM
Today I learned about how list comprehensions work in Python!
Productivity Rating: 4/5

import datetime

OUPUT_JOURNAL_FILE: str = "learning_journal.txt"
entry = input("What did you learn today ? ").strip()
rating = input("⭐️ rate your productivity today (1-5, optional) ").strip()

now = datetime.datetime.now()
date_str = now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d - %I:%M %p")

journal_entry = f"\n 🗓️ {date_str}\n{entry}"
if rating:
    journal_entry += f"\n Productivity Rating: {rating}\n"
journal_entry += "\n" + "-" * 50

with open(OUPUT_JOURNAL_FILE, "a", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write(journal_entry)

print(f"\n your journal entry has been saved to {OUPUT_JOURNAL_FILE} file. ")
